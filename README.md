## ExaJS: The Exa-to-JavaScript Compiler

This system compiles Exa programs into JavaScript.

#### Installation

Standard Node: clone the repo then in the project root folder:

    $ npm install -g
    
#### To run the examples

	$ cd examples
	$ exa factorial.exa 10
	3628800
	
etc.

#### To run the tests

#### Parsing

Scanning and parsing are handled by a parser generated by Jison.

#### Code Generation

The compiler generates JavaScript source from the AST bottom-up by snapping together chunks of JS wrapped in the following classes.

**JsConstruct**

Base class for holding chunks of JS; expands helper objects such as argument lists.

**SyncMessage**

Models a synchronous message by wrapping supplied code in a Message.
