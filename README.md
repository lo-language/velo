# Exa

Exa is a concurrent, message-oriented programming language designed for building robust, scalable, networked applications in the real world, where security is critical and failures happen.

To learn about the language, see the [docs](docs).

This is an implementation of Exa as a compiler targeting JavaScript. The exa "binary" is a load-and-go compiler that can also be used to generate Node.js executables. Modules are parsed and compiled when loaded.

#### Installation

Clone the repo then in the project root folder do:

    $ npm install -g

#### To run an Exa program

    $ exa <source file>

This will compile the Exa source, load it, and run.

#### To build a Node executable

    $ exa --build-node <target file> <source file>

#### To run the tests 

In the project root folder:

    $ npm test

# Implementation

#### Parsing

Scanning and parsing are handled by a parser generated by ANTLR.

#### Code Generation

The compiler generates JavaScript source from the AST bottom-up by snapping together chunks of JS wrapped in the following classes:

- **JsConstruct**: base class for holding chunks of JS; expands helper objects such as argument lists and resolves SyncMessages when required
- **SyncMessage**: models a synchronous message by wrapping supplied code in a Message

#### Runtime

The Exa runtime provides the implementation of the Exa task tree as well as the module loader, which pulls in the parser/compiler. Classes include:

- **Task**: models an Exa task and provides the ability to reply or fail, as well as send requests.
