Exa is a simple and practical programming language designed for building secure, scalable software systems in the real world â€“ where failures are commonplace and testability is essential.

The central thesis of Exa is that with proper isolation between modules, security and concurrency - two notoriously difficult aspects of software engineering neglected by virtually all popular languages - are free. Not just easy, but an automatic consequence of modularity. And this isn't even a new idea.

The language rests on a simple and intuitive model of computation - communicating event loops - and is designed to feel familiar despite rejecting some core assumptions shared by most languages; Exa is a friendly syntax wrapping radically different semantics:

- All modules are totally isolated from each other, except for asynchronous requests.
- Failure is a clear, simple, first-class concept: every request can succeed or fail.
- All procedures can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously at the caller's discretion.
- There are no classes; objects are derived from procedure environments rather than data structures - you can't hold a direct reference to an object, only an interface to it.

#### Implementation

This is an implementation of Exa as a transpiler to JavaScript. The exa "binary" is a load-and-go compiler, but you can also use it to generate Node.js executables. Modules are parsed and compiled when loaded.

#### Installation

Clone the repo then in the project root folder do:

    $ npm install -g

#### To run an Exa program

    $ exa <source file>

This will compile the Exa source, load it, and run.

#### To build a Node executable

    $ exa --build <target file> <source file>

#### To run the examples

	$ cd examples
	$ exa factorial.exa 10
	3628800
	
etc.

#### To run the tests 

In the project root folder:

    $ npm test

# How it Works

#### Parsing

Scanning and parsing are handled by a parser generated by Jison.

#### Code Generation

The compiler generates JavaScript source from the AST bottom-up by snapping together chunks of JS wrapped in the following classes:

**JsConstruct**: base class for holding chunks of JS; expands helper objects such as argument lists and resolves SyncMessages when required

**SyncMessage**: models a synchronous message by wrapping supplied code in a Message

#### Runtime

The Exa runtime provides the implementation of the Exa Task tree as well as the module loader, which pulls in the parser/compiler.
