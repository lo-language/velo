## A Lo-to-JavaScript compiler, written in Node.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lo-language/velo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lo-language/velo)

This is a proof-of-concept compiler for the [Lo](http://lo-language.org) programming language. It operates as a load-and-go compiler to compile, load, and run a Lo program within a Node environment.

## Installation

Clone the repo then in the project root folder do:

    $ npm install -g
    
#### To run the test suite

In the project root folder:

    $ npm test
    
## Usage

#### To compile and run a program

    $ velo run <root module>

The root module of a Lo program must define a `main` service that takes two arguments: `args` and `system`, for example:

    main is <-> (args, system) {
    
        system.out("Hello, world!");
    };

The first argument is the array of strings provided on the command line after the root module name (arguments before the root module name are handled by Velo). The second argument is the [system API](system.md) object, which contains all the authority available to the program.


#### To compile a program and dump the JavaScript to the console

    $ velo dump <root module>
    
#### To build a statically-linked Node.js executable

Not implemented yet, but will look like:

    $ velo build <root module>

## Module Bindings

Velo provides several built-in module namespaces.

### JavaScript Built-In Objects

Velo maps the various JavaScript built-in objects to modules under the `JS` namespace, but omits any calls that depend on ambient authority, such as Math.random().

For example, this program uses the `Math` built-in object.

    main is <-> (args, system) {
    
        system.out(JS::Math.E);
    };

### Node.js Core Modules

The Node.js core modules that don't require ambient authority can be referenced using the `Node` namespace.

    main is <-> (args, system) {
    
        system.out(Node::querystring);
    };

### NPM Modules

Arbitrary NPM modules that don't require ambient authority can be linked in using the `NPM` namespace.

    main is <-> (args, system) {
    
        system.out(NPM::HTTP);
    };

## Implementation

#### Parsing

Scanning and parsing are handled by a parser generated by ANTLR; a Lo AST is constructed and handed to the backend.

#### Code Generation

Each node in the Lo AST compiles itself to a JavaScript AST which is then rendered into JavaScript. By default the compiler will cache compiled modules on disk (like a built-in make).

#### Runtime

The runtime consists of Task.js, which implements the Lo task tree.

#### Testing Strategy

Parsing, code generation, and runtime methods are tested independently, as is the pipeline logic (linking and loading). To make sure this all adds up to Lo programs that actually do what they should, there are integration tests in the `programs` directory that read in a program, run it, and inspect the result.
