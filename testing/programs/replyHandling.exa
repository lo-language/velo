// exercises the spec around processing sync messages vs. async replies

receive foo, bar;

value = 0;

// send an async message that returns quickly
after foo ~ 1:
    // value should always be whatever's returned by bar() here
    reply value;

// send a sync message that returns slowly
value = bar();
