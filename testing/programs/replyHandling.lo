// exercises the spec around processing sync messages vs. async replies

main is (foo, bar) {

    value = 0;

    // send an async message that returns quickly
    @foo -> () {

        // value should always be whatever's returned by bar() here
        reply value;
    }

    // send a sync message that returns slowly
    value = bar();
