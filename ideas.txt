symbols - like lisp

expect - declarations above action to validate input

config vars - some way to declare vars to be set outside the program - maybe all literals are automatically config vars?
maybe there's no way to have literals at all - they're all config vars?

libraries - collections of modules, local and online



lots of little black boxes in space

The goal of Exa is to provide a way to express programmatic intent as clearly and concisely as possible.
The goal is not to "be fast". The goal is not to be terse. The goal is not to be "pure" in some way or another.
